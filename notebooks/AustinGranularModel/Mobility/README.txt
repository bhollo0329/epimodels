The VISITORS subdirectory has the “adjusted” number of unique visitors from source cbg to dest cbg. Safegraph provides a “visitor_home_cbg” json for each place of interest. Those numbers are the unique visitors from the sampled population in that cbg. The adjusted number of unique visitors is found my multiplying the raw number by (population in cbg)/(sample size in cbg). That sample size changes from week to week, and is provided in the home panel summary files per week. The unique visitors from source cbg to place of interest in a give cbg (dest cbg) are rolled up and aggregated to the cbg level. Those cbgs are then mapped to zipcodes and aggregated.
The VISITS subdirectory has the weekly number of visits from source cbg to dest cbg. The safegraph data provides total_raw_visits to POI and total_raw_visitors to POI. We can compute total adjusted visitors to POI from the method in step 1, then find total adjusted visits to POI by multiplying “total_adjust_visitors” by the ratio of total_raw_visits/total_raw_visitors. Analagously, we can find the total adjust visits to CBG, from CBG. We can also add up the total raw numbers and get total raw visits and total raw visitors to CBG from CBG. That allows us to compute the adjusted total visits to a CBG from a CBG in a given week.
The top level directory then uses the values in 1) and 2) to estimate visits per day from source cbg to dest cbg. This is the only “by day” value. I am given “visits by day” in the safegraph data for each POI. I’m just estimating per cbg.
